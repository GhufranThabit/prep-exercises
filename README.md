# traffic light

- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?
- What happens if you change the loop to a `do-while` loop instead of a `while` loop? Why?
- We could have also used a `for` loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?
